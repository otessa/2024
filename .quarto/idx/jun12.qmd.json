Building on this background work, we explore the values and attitudes of the academics who undertake open textbook production with student co- creators. Student inclusion is lauded in research as essential for student belonging, but little work has been done to look for the challenges involved when traditional power dynamics are disrupted. In this research, we describe a potential nexus of three complementary components: open textbooks, social justice, and students as partners. We investigate the affordances of the open textbook to facilitate change in the power dynamics of content production as well as in classroom practice.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 12:00-12:30 | Break\n\n  \n# 12:30-1:15 | Parallel Session 1 \n## Invited Speakers\n\n45 Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n### 1.1 | Speaker \n\n5 Things You Need to Know Before You Buy Edtech\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nDrawing on experiences of over 20 years in higher education technology, working across commercial and open technology contexts, this talk proposes that the procurement of educational technologies is fundamentally flawed both as a practice and as a process. Institutional processes such as procurement tend to be absent from conversations about digital education, often acknowledged as problematic but also outside our sphere of influence or domain of expertise. On the basis that pedagogy and technology are entangled in complex ways, in fact the opposite should be true. The educational technologies we use are not tools, and should be treated as matters of quality when we consider what good digital education might look like, and what we think the purpose of education is.\n\nConsideration of ethics are often absent from procurement of technology, largely based on instrumentalist assumptions about the neutrality of technologies. Public sector procurement “best practice” also forces us to use poor proxies for our educational values, purposes, and contexts, and creates new risks and liabilities for institutions, at the same time as it seeks to minimise others. Whilst this talk will explore potential solutions to current procurement process and practice, the question that remains outstanding is whether we are simply buying and/or using too much educational technology, and whether, in order to achieve more environmentally sustainable and just forms of education, we should be embracing a de-growth approach to educational technology more generally?\nHow much procurement of edtech, however well executed, is too much?\n:::\n\n### 1.2 | Speaker\n\nCanadian Digital Learning Research Association/Association canadienne de recherche sur la formation en ligne\n\nDigital Learning Trends in Canadian Post-Secondary Education\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nJoin Dr. Nicole Johnson, Executive Director of the Canadian Digital Learning Research Association/Association canadienne de recherche sur la formation en ligne (CDLRA/ACRFL), as she shares how digital learning trends are changing over time and discusses what this means for the future of post-secondary education in Canada. Since 2017, the CDLRA/ACRFL has conducted annual pan-Canadian surveys to track trends related to digital learning at Canadian post-secondary institutions. In particular, since 2020, the CDLRA/ACRFL has been investigating the ongoing impact of the pandemic on course delivery and teaching practices. Through her independent research and consulting practice, Dr. Johnson has also worked on multiple other studies related to faculty experiences with technology, categorizing learning experiences by modality, and the future of higher education. In this presentation, Dr. Johnson will discuss challenges faced by institutions (and the post-secondary sector as a whole), what the future might hold, and recommendations for the sector.\n:::\n\n# 1:15-1:30 | Break  \n\n# 1:30-3:00 | Concurrent Session 2\n\n## 2.1 |  Wildcard \n\n### 1:30-2:30 | Escape Rooms for Education  \nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of the COVID pandemic on post-secondary teaching and learning experiences was student disengagement. While gamification was a strategy that was occasionally used in junior-level anatomy and physiology courses pre-pandemic, it became an increasingly important pedagogical strategy during emergency remote teaching for students to become invested in their learning. Escape rooms, which are immersive storytelling games, are one form of gamification. Educational escape rooms, which can be adapted to be in-person or virtual, incorporate learning objectives into individual or team-based games, puzzles and clues, and require students to demonstrate mastery of the material to progress through the storyline. This type of activity not only helps to increase student engagement, but also provides an opportunity to develop soft skills like creativity, teamwork, decision-making, critical thinking and communication that are important in health professionals.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | A(nother) Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against (or For?) Course Hero  \nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nUsing Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against Turnitin” as its foil, this presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by personalities of influence.\n:::\n\n\n##  2.2 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n### 1:30-2:30 | Engaging in Open Pedagogy: Insights from Designing and Teaching Post-Secondary STEM Courses \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhat is Open Pedagogy?\nOpen Pedagogy (OP) is a process, a way of thinking and a way of acting.\nOP is not a collection of pedagogical procedures. It does not have a set of predetermined outcomes.\nOP is intentionally inclusive, intentionally ethical, and reflective practice.\nIn this workshop we will look at the implications of “open” in a college setting.\nHow to engage in Open Pedagogy in a STEM college course?\nWe will have a look at the Physics for Health course: its design, teaching strategies, and OER that support OP.\nWe will discuss what does it mean in practice to participate in OP and what opportunities it presents to support diverse learners and what challenges such practice presents for an educator.\nThe following questions will guide the workshop:  \n- How can Open Educational Resources extend into Open Pedagogy?  \n- How similar and different Open Pedagogy and Inclusive Pedagogy are?  \n- How can Open Pedagogy impact accessibility and inclusion?  \n- What is the teacher’s role in Open Pedagogy?  \n- What role does technology play in Open Pedagogy?  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | An Upgrade to Ungrading: Alternative Grading in Higher Education \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe various practices of “ungrading” have gained increasing popularity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Ungrading – or what we prefer to call alt-grading – can increase intrinsic motivation, alleviate anxiety associated with judgment, and can invite students to take intellectual risks without fear of being punished or suffering long-term effects if an academic experiment does not work. The many benefits of alternative grading include some degree of freedom from such stress and fear. However, most university administrations resist revisions to traditional grading, and as such, precarious faculty with their students’ best interests at heart often struggle to implement creative, helpful strategies to release students from the stressful grip of judgment and grades. Further, some ungrading “purists” (particularly on social media) are unwelcoming to educators who must or would like to include some fundamental parts of ungrading but must still “fit” within the constraints of the traditional university grading system. This interactive, helpful, and friendly session will be a candid look at what alternative grading really is, what it could be, and how innovative educators seeking to work within a traditional system can address how to move forward with alternatives that are legitimate “upgrades” to “ungrading.”\n:::\n\n\n## 2.3 |  Transitions of Online Learning & Teaching \n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Creating Capacity for Capabilities: Using Professional Development within Learning Design in Capstone \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nDuring the peak of the pandemic, where emergency remote learning was required, undergraduate students trying to complete a business degree had a choice between business capstone and practicum. Unfortunately for our students, there were nearly no positions available as businesses had decreased their workforce numbers so substantially and were canceling practicum positions. This created a very large influx of students through the capstone pathway. This 6-credit hour course is a culmination of student learning throughout the degree and is the final experience prior to graduation. A growing number of industry and scholarly reports explore the disconnect between graduate capabilities and employer expectations regarding workplace skill competencies (Lapointe & Turner, 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; RBC, 2019). Highlighted through consecutive semesters of capstone through 2020 to 2022, an opportunity arose to scaffold a professional development module into the learning design. The author will present the structure, purpose, implementation, and challenges of the module and provide initial insights of the value and iteration through this time period. The content of the module will be shared as it leans into open and accessible training and development. A discussion of the current state and collaboratively brainstorming options next iteration will be undertaken.\n\n:::\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | “Leave No One Behind.” Peer Support for Teachers: Reflections on a Digital Pedagogy Development Project \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis presentation overviews and discusses an on-going peer support method launched by a Finnish university for their teaching staff. The aim of the peer support method is to further develop the pedagogical and digital skills adopted during the Covid19 pandemic. Moreover, its aim is to re-imagine higher education by promoting best practices of online learning and teaching based on staff experiences and relevant research.\n\nThe university recruited a team of five experienced lecturers from within its four faculties and the Language Centre to work as pedagogical support to their peers at a 50% work-time allocation, the other 50% of their work still consisting of teaching. The team recently finished its first two-year operation period and has analysed and reported the successes and challenges of the first two years, with recommendations for the following two years.\n\nThe team’s analysis of the first two-year period indicates that this peer support mode has proven a necessary modus operandi. In an institution of higher education with its multiple departments, units, boards, working groups, committees, support services, and digital services, the voice of a single teacher may too easily go unheard.\n\nIn its reflexive analysis of the first two years of operation, the team highlights four areas of success. Alongside with the successes, challenges do remain, and must be addressed in the following two years of operation. The main challenges are directly connected to the successes. The core challenge concerns the need to keep improving university-wide, accessible, and efficient communication of all the services and support that are available to the teaching staff.\n:::\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | Mediating Relationship and Sexual Health Education \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis session will outline the development of a youth sexual health education program adapted from a series of facilitated in-person workshops to a self-guided, asynchronous online format. The development focused on three key considerations: (1) accessibility, which includes addressing different learning and physical abilities, as well as technical elements relating to devices and rural internet networks; (2) privacy, which includes protection of student information, questions relating to cross-border data hosting, and the ability of participants to ask questions and receive support anonymously; and (3) mediation, which includes how the design of the course must compensate for the loss of an in-person facilitator. The course modules have focused on the use of narrative as a strategy for introducing concepts, connecting to real-world scenarios, and promoting empathy and engagement in the absence of a facilitator. The session will discuss how choices of tools and technologies have addressed the program’s stated considerations, as well as allowed for innovative use of character and storytelling to promote sexual health education.\n\n:::\n\n\n## 2.4 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Sharing Experience Regarding OER Creation and Adoption as a Tool to Manage Student Engagement \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis presentation supports the view that Open Educational Resources (OER) have positive impact on pedagogy and student engagement. OER supporters believe that OERs offer compelling implications on pedagogy including increasing level of student engagement and pedagogical innovation (Open Education Quality Initiatives, 2011 and Orr et al., 2015). A community college faculty member and administrator who supported the faculty member with the Open Educational Resources (OER) project will share how creation and adaptation of OER in the course lead to positive impact on student engagement. OER enabled pedagogy assures student engagement as well increases self-regulated motivation (Werth & Williams, 2021). A notation that the supporting administrator has noticed is that when the same faculty member designs the OER and then facilitates the course, the OER is adopted then anecdotally has greater results then when OER is adopted without creative input or customization. The administrator wonders that if faculty do not have the time to evaluate content to the same degree as an OER creator does they may lose the value of deep connection with content as noted by Skidmore (2019).\n:::\n\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | Developing a Learning Design Framework: A Collective Process Intended to Foster Collaboration \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal describes the development of a learning design framework by an instructional design team in an open learning division of a medium-sized university. The team recognized the need for a foundation that reflected their values and guiding principles for design and aimed to build tools that would strengthen collaborative relationships and create a more inclusive and learner-centered experience. The framework is intended to be used as a tool for framing conversations with collaborative teams to ensure the principles of caring, connection, openness and active learning are considered in our learning design. In the presentation, we will provide examples of the framework and its underlying principles and focus on how it can support collaborations among various teams and stakeholders. The team is still in the process of building collaborative and practical elements to support course development and will share both these projects and how the framework is helping to reframe processes and clarify roles.\n:::\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | Reimagining Art and Culture by Decolonizing Digitization \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nMuseums, archives, galleries, and libraries have balanced their responsibility to protect the world’s most important cultural artifacts with their roles as important pillars of public education. However, these goals become increasingly at odds with each other if the institution doesn’t take a deliberately decolonial, and anticolonial, stance towards curatorial work. Left unexamined, contemporary curatorial practice still carries the legacies of colonization, which is visible in the metadata of digitized collections from major institutions like the British Museum.\n\nThis presentation outlines the necessary role of decolonial practice in GLAM-field digitization projects as well as in the digital tools that make this content available to public audiences. By centering on the co-developed metadata tools of Curationist, we will offer not only an introduction to this platform and its uses to digital art and open education, but also a method of online community development that centers indigenous data sovereignty, community engagement, and decolonization practices to rebalance the power dynamic in collections-based open education.\n:::\n\n\n## 2.5 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n\n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Qu’en est-il de l’enseignement et de l’apprentissage de la danse à distance ? Adaptations et défis (in French) \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe health measures imposed in 2020-2021 have led to the development of distance learning courses in the field of leisure. Be it music, yoga, cooking, etc., many courses have been offered online. This has been particularly the case with dance. As distance learning dance classes were rare before the pandemic, new practices had to be developed. How have dancers adapted to this change in training mode and what challenges have they faced in teaching or learning online? In this paper, we propose to look at the challenges faced by teachers and learners of recreational dance. To do so, we will rely not only on the literature published on the subject, but also and especially, on interviews conducted with 78 professional and amateur dancers living in Quebec and France. We will highlight the technologies and teaching methods used in these courses as well as their advantages and limitations according to the teachers and learners. We will then open a discussion on the perspectives of online dance courses.\n:::\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | Que dit la recherche des approches pour contrer l’isolement en FAD ? (in French) \n\nResearch\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhile student isolation was a major issue during the pandemic, a systematic review of the literature conducted as part of the SSHRC’s Knowledge Synthesis program allowed us to review the scientific literature on support aimed at limiting the sense of isolation of students in distance education (DE). This study was conducted on scientific papers published between 2012 and 2022 and led to the examination of 301 articles in French or in English. The analysis of these publications highlights three main approaches to supporting distance education students: the approach focused on developing student autonomy and commitment; the approach focused on the support of a teacher or mentor; and the approach focused on peer-to-peer interactions and collaborative work. In this paper, we propose to review each of these three approaches and to outline the strengths and weaknesses that researchers have identified. We can then discuss how they can be addressed to provide DE. Finally, we will conclude with some possible directions for future research.\n:::\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | A Framework for Evaluating the Creation and Adaptation of Open Textbooks \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in dramatic growth in the use of open education resources, such as open textbooks, as classes moved online around the world. This highlighted the importance of evaluating the creation and adaptation of open textbooks used in online courses. In reviewing the research literature, I found existing rubrics or frameworks were outdated and lacked criteria that are important in today’s digital age. Therefore, I synthesized the evaluation and quality criteria from 31 articles into a single framework, which online instructors can consider using as they create or adapt an open textbook. The criteria include content, accessibility, technology, open licenses, instructional design, and a new category I termed verification.\n:::\n\n\n# 3:00-3:45  | Break \n\n\n# 3:45-5:15 | Concurrent Session 3 \n\n1.5 Hours\n\n## 3.1 |  Addressing Inequities \n\n\n\n\n### 3:45-4:45 | The Seemingly Small Details that are Easily Overlooked in Designing Inclusive Online Courses \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhile distance and online education are not new, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges that students can face with online learning. These challenges can magnify inequity and increase resistance to learning. Many educators have used the pandemic as motivation to reassess their courses but still often overlook seemingly small aspects that can make a big difference for students. Examples of these aspects might include mobile compatibility, video length, and technological requirements. The three panelists are experienced instructional designers and instructors who have focused on improving accessibility in online learning in a variety of contexts. They will share their experiences as both advocates and skeptics on why we need to take the small things into account to develop courses which facilitate learning for all students without exhausting instructors who are experiencing their own barriers and challenges.\n:::\n\n\n### 4:45-5:15 | Podcasting for Student Agency \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis article explores the potential of podcasting as a useful education technology for promoting agency in preservice teacher education programs. The authors propose a mixed-methods study to investigate the impact of co-creating podcasts as a holistic pedagogical practice. Reporting on the first phase of this research, podcasting appears to helpfully assess student learning. Additionally, it is a powerful technology that can mobilize knowledge created by preservice teachers beyond the classroom. Next stages in the research will incorporate in-service teachers to provide generative feedback, thereby creating a Community of Inquiry between podcasters and listeners.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.2 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n### 3:45-4:45 | The Slow Trend Toward K-12 OER Sharing\n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nFor K-12 teachers sharing resources is a long established professional practice and with the affordances of digital technologies the ability to file share has been amplified. However, there are technological and copyright implications of sharing curricular teaching content that requires more support and understanding. Copyright ease and ethical sharing of curriculum resources is provided by open licenses yet pre-service and graduate education students currently receive inconsistent tutelage of these licenses. To fill this niche for understanding, locating, or creating OER, the website Openteacherab.ca has been developed. Further support for these students to determine OER quality is the ISKME curation framework that assists with the selection and assessment of pre-existing K-12 OER. Looking to Washington State provides a further example of support for the slow trend toward K-12 OER sharing and development.\n:::\n\n### 4:45-5:15 | Letting Go of Holding On: Promoting Student Choice in a Post- Pandemic Classroom \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe pandemic has forced teachers to adapt with greater flexibility to meet changing classroom environments and student needs, resulting in a shift in pedagogy towards promoting more intrinsic motivation and student autonomy. OTESSA’s theme of “Reckonings and Re-imaginings” reflects this transition, inviting educators to re-evaluate their approach. One effective way to achieve this kind of shift is to give students more freedom and choice in their learning, as supported by the work of Evans and Boucher (2015). This presentation will outline practical strategies for promoting more student choice in the classroom, such as incorporating formative assessment exercises, opening student work to include OER projects, and tips on changing one’s teaching mindset. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on opportunities for making small but meaningful changes to their pedagogy to inspire more student autonomy.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.3 |  Wildcard \n\n\n\n### 3:45 - 4:45 | Whiteboard Animation for Dental Education |  Research \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nTeaching complex scientific concepts in an engaging manner is challenging for educators. Animated videos can explain concepts and engage students by combining audio messages with changing graphics. Whiteboard animation is a style of animated video where the content appears to be hand-drawn on a whiteboard and narrated in a storytelling manner. This technique has the benefits of traditional animations, with the added ability to combine visual thinking and storytelling. Whiteboard animations were successfully applied to explain health-related topics. Creating a successful whiteboard animation requires paid software, time, and drawing skills. Most whiteboard animation software is designed for business advertising and does not provide the graphics gallery needed to explain health science-related topics.\n\nWe used traditional PowerPoint and hand-drawn digital images to create whiteboard animation explaining topics for dental education. The built-in animations of PowerPoint were used to animate the images and supporting text.\n\nWe aim to create a series of whiteboard animations for dental students. According to Dewey, learning is a social activity resulting from human interactions. Studies found that avatars, cartoon characters, dialogues, and simulated real-world settings in animated videos serve an essential social function in engaging students. We hope the whiteboard animations will be beneficial for dental students.\n:::\n\n\n### 4:45 - 5:15 | In-class gaming to improve students’ learning experiences in dental education \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nHigher educational institutes increasingly focus on incorporating games and simulations to enhance student engagement. Gamification refers to using or adopting game mechanics, techniques, and game theory in a non-game platform, like education. Many health professional education courses have successfully applied gamification. Online games like Kahoot are shown to increase student satisfaction and motivation, help students overcome individual difficulties, and improve collaboration. Gimkit is a new gaming platform that allows instructors to create quiz games that students can play live in class. The instantly generated code by the host allows students to enter live games without having an account or registration. We have introduced in-class gaming using Gimkit in the Dentistry and Dental Hygiene program at the University of Alberta. The effect of playing games on student learning, motivation, engagement, and satisfaction will be evaluated. We believe in-class gaming will be a positive incorporation in didactic dental education to enhance student motivation and engagement.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.4 |  Transitions of Online Learning & Teaching \n\n\n\n\n\n### 3:45 - 4:45 | Encadrer des étudiant.es à distance : Description des pratiques de nouveaux professeure.s (in French) \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nCanadian higher education institutions are placing increasing emphasis on the development of distance education (DE) and online learning (Bates et al., 2017). Historically, in ADF institutions, the “traditional” teaching process is split into two phases. In the first stage, courses are designed by a professor or design team. Thereafter, student mentoring is assumed by a professor or designee (Racette et al., 2017). This involves accompanying students in their learning process, acting as a moderator, facilitator, coach, pedagogical mentor, e-tutor, coach, etc.\n\nWhen they take up their positions, new professors are quickly called upon to develop distance supervision practices and, as Vachon (2013) points out, to develop multiple skills such as written and oral communication, the use of ICT, etc.\n\nOver the past few months, a research team has been conducting an analysis of distance education student supervision practices. This research project, financed by the Fonds de recherche – Société et culture du gouvernement du Québec (FRQSC), allowed the deployment of the Observatoire du cours d’action. This theoretical framework allowed for the deployment of the relative life course tool, a methodological tool derived from the semiotic framework of the course of action (Theureau, 2004, 2009).\n\nThis project has three objectives: (1) to describe the coaching practices of new teachers in their ADF courses, (2) to explain how the coaching practices of new teachers evolve over time, and (3) to analyze how new teachers develop their skills in coaching practices in ADF courses.\n\nIn this paper, we propose to present the mentoring practices of new professors in distance education courses over the past few years.\n:::\n\n\n# Discussion/Networking Pod | 6:15-6:30 \n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n> Join us at the #OTESSA23 Morning Radio Show Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, May 29, 30, and 31 from 6:30 – 7:30 am (Eastern) at https://voiced.ca\n\n\n\n# 10:30-12:30\n## Welcome Desk Open  \n \n\n# 10:30-11:00\n## Conference Welcome, Announcements & Land Acknowledgement \n \n\n\n\n# 11:00-12:00 | Keynote 1\n\nEnabling ‘Students as Partners’: Open Textbooks, Power Shifts and Curriculum Transformation \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWork done with open textbook creators at UCT has enabled the DOT4D initiative to articulate models of open textbook production that are being employed by academics at UCT who are using their open textbooks to address social (in)justice in the classroom.

While gamification was a strategy that was occasionally used in junior-level anatomy and physiology courses pre-pandemic, it became an increasingly important pedagogical strategy during emergency remote teaching for students to become invested in their learning. Escape rooms, which are immersive storytelling games, are one form of gamification. Educational escape rooms, which can be adapted to be in-person or virtual, incorporate learning objectives into individual or team-based games, puzzles and clues, and require students to demonstrate mastery of the material to progress through the storyline. This type of activity not only helps to increase student engagement, but also provides an opportunity to develop soft skills like creativity, teamwork, decision-making, critical thinking and communication that are important in health professionals.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | A(nother) Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against (or For?) Course Hero  \nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nUsing Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel’s landmark essay “A Guide for Resisting EdTech: The Case Against Turnitin” as its foil, this presentation asks participants to apply the same kinds of critiques applied effectively to Turnitin in that piece to Course Hero as we evaluate its claims against the benchmarks of ethical educational technologies. This experiment in collective meaning-making provides a model for critiquing tools that have been carefully marketed but not well-studied by academics, offering a “way in” to these discussions that is rooted in the practical and factual, and not so profoundly shaped by personalities of influence.\n:::\n\n\n##  2.2 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n### 1:30-2:30 | Engaging in Open Pedagogy: Insights from Designing and Teaching Post-Secondary STEM Courses \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhat is Open Pedagogy?\nOpen Pedagogy (OP) is a process, a way of thinking and a way of acting.\nOP is not a collection of pedagogical procedures. It does not have a set of predetermined outcomes.\nOP is intentionally inclusive, intentionally ethical, and reflective practice.\nIn this workshop we will look at the implications of “open” in a college setting.\nHow to engage in Open Pedagogy in a STEM college course?\nWe will have a look at the Physics for Health course: its design, teaching strategies, and OER that support OP.\nWe will discuss what does it mean in practice to participate in OP and what opportunities it presents to support diverse learners and what challenges such practice presents for an educator.\nThe following questions will guide the workshop:  \n- How can Open Educational Resources extend into Open Pedagogy?  \n- How similar and different Open Pedagogy and Inclusive Pedagogy are?  \n- How can Open Pedagogy impact accessibility and inclusion?  \n- What is the teacher’s role in Open Pedagogy?  \n- What role does technology play in Open Pedagogy?  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | An Upgrade to Ungrading: Alternative Grading in Higher Education \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe various practices of “ungrading” have gained increasing popularity, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Ungrading – or what we prefer to call alt-grading – can increase intrinsic motivation, alleviate anxiety associated with judgment, and can invite students to take intellectual risks without fear of being punished or suffering long-term effects if an academic experiment does not work. The many benefits of alternative grading include some degree of freedom from such stress and fear. However, most university administrations resist revisions to traditional grading, and as such, precarious faculty with their students’ best interests at heart often struggle to implement creative, helpful strategies to release students from the stressful grip of judgment and grades. Further, some ungrading “purists” (particularly on social media) are unwelcoming to educators who must or would like to include some fundamental parts of ungrading but must still “fit” within the constraints of the traditional university grading system. This interactive, helpful, and friendly session will be a candid look at what alternative grading really is, what it could be, and how innovative educators seeking to work within a traditional system can address how to move forward with alternatives that are legitimate “upgrades” to “ungrading.”\n:::\n\n\n## 2.3 |  Transitions of Online Learning & Teaching \n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Creating Capacity for Capabilities: Using Professional Development within Learning Design in Capstone \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nDuring the peak of the pandemic, where emergency remote learning was required, undergraduate students trying to complete a business degree had a choice between business capstone and practicum. Unfortunately for our students, there were nearly no positions available as businesses had decreased their workforce numbers so substantially and were canceling practicum positions. This created a very large influx of students through the capstone pathway. This 6-credit hour course is a culmination of student learning throughout the degree and is the final experience prior to graduation. A growing number of industry and scholarly reports explore the disconnect between graduate capabilities and employer expectations regarding workplace skill competencies (Lapointe & Turner, 2020; Mishra et al., 2019; RBC, 2019). Highlighted through consecutive semesters of capstone through 2020 to 2022, an opportunity arose to scaffold a professional development module into the learning design. The author will present the structure, purpose, implementation, and challenges of the module and provide initial insights of the value and iteration through this time period. The content of the module will be shared as it leans into open and accessible training and development. A discussion of the current state and collaboratively brainstorming options next iteration will be undertaken.\n\n:::\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | “Leave No One Behind.” Peer Support for Teachers: Reflections on a Digital Pedagogy Development Project \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis presentation overviews and discusses an on-going peer support method launched by a Finnish university for their teaching staff. The aim of the peer support method is to further develop the pedagogical and digital skills adopted during the Covid19 pandemic. Moreover, its aim is to re-imagine higher education by promoting best practices of online learning and teaching based on staff experiences and relevant research.\n\nThe university recruited a team of five experienced lecturers from within its four faculties and the Language Centre to work as pedagogical support to their peers at a 50% work-time allocation, the other 50% of their work still consisting of teaching. The team recently finished its first two-year operation period and has analysed and reported the successes and challenges of the first two years, with recommendations for the following two years.\n\nThe team’s analysis of the first two-year period indicates that this peer support mode has proven a necessary modus operandi. In an institution of higher education with its multiple departments, units, boards, working groups, committees, support services, and digital services, the voice of a single teacher may too easily go unheard.\n\nIn its reflexive analysis of the first two years of operation, the team highlights four areas of success. Alongside with the successes, challenges do remain, and must be addressed in the following two years of operation. The main challenges are directly connected to the successes. The core challenge concerns the need to keep improving university-wide, accessible, and efficient communication of all the services and support that are available to the teaching staff.\n:::\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | Mediating Relationship and Sexual Health Education \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis session will outline the development of a youth sexual health education program adapted from a series of facilitated in-person workshops to a self-guided, asynchronous online format. The development focused on three key considerations: (1) accessibility, which includes addressing different learning and physical abilities, as well as technical elements relating to devices and rural internet networks; (2) privacy, which includes protection of student information, questions relating to cross-border data hosting, and the ability of participants to ask questions and receive support anonymously; and (3) mediation, which includes how the design of the course must compensate for the loss of an in-person facilitator. The course modules have focused on the use of narrative as a strategy for introducing concepts, connecting to real-world scenarios, and promoting empathy and engagement in the absence of a facilitator. The session will discuss how choices of tools and technologies have addressed the program’s stated considerations, as well as allowed for innovative use of character and storytelling to promote sexual health education.\n\n:::\n\n\n## 2.4 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Sharing Experience Regarding OER Creation and Adoption as a Tool to Manage Student Engagement \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis presentation supports the view that Open Educational Resources (OER) have positive impact on pedagogy and student engagement. OER supporters believe that OERs offer compelling implications on pedagogy including increasing level of student engagement and pedagogical innovation (Open Education Quality Initiatives, 2011 and Orr et al., 2015). A community college faculty member and administrator who supported the faculty member with the Open Educational Resources (OER) project will share how creation and adaptation of OER in the course lead to positive impact on student engagement. OER enabled pedagogy assures student engagement as well increases self-regulated motivation (Werth & Williams, 2021). A notation that the supporting administrator has noticed is that when the same faculty member designs the OER and then facilitates the course, the OER is adopted then anecdotally has greater results then when OER is adopted without creative input or customization. The administrator wonders that if faculty do not have the time to evaluate content to the same degree as an OER creator does they may lose the value of deep connection with content as noted by Skidmore (2019).\n:::\n\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | Developing a Learning Design Framework: A Collective Process Intended to Foster Collaboration \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal describes the development of a learning design framework by an instructional design team in an open learning division of a medium-sized university. The team recognized the need for a foundation that reflected their values and guiding principles for design and aimed to build tools that would strengthen collaborative relationships and create a more inclusive and learner-centered experience. The framework is intended to be used as a tool for framing conversations with collaborative teams to ensure the principles of caring, connection, openness and active learning are considered in our learning design. In the presentation, we will provide examples of the framework and its underlying principles and focus on how it can support collaborations among various teams and stakeholders. The team is still in the process of building collaborative and practical elements to support course development and will share both these projects and how the framework is helping to reframe processes and clarify roles.\n:::\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | Reimagining Art and Culture by Decolonizing Digitization \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nMuseums, archives, galleries, and libraries have balanced their responsibility to protect the world’s most important cultural artifacts with their roles as important pillars of public education. However, these goals become increasingly at odds with each other if the institution doesn’t take a deliberately decolonial, and anticolonial, stance towards curatorial work. Left unexamined, contemporary curatorial practice still carries the legacies of colonization, which is visible in the metadata of digitized collections from major institutions like the British Museum.\n\nThis presentation outlines the necessary role of decolonial practice in GLAM-field digitization projects as well as in the digital tools that make this content available to public audiences. By centering on the co-developed metadata tools of Curationist, we will offer not only an introduction to this platform and its uses to digital art and open education, but also a method of online community development that centers indigenous data sovereignty, community engagement, and decolonization practices to rebalance the power dynamic in collections-based open education.\n:::\n\n\n## 2.5 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n\n\n### 1:30-2:00 | Qu’en est-il de l’enseignement et de l’apprentissage de la danse à distance ? Adaptations et défis (in French) \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe health measures imposed in 2020-2021 have led to the development of distance learning courses in the field of leisure. Be it music, yoga, cooking, etc., many courses have been offered online. This has been particularly the case with dance. As distance learning dance classes were rare before the pandemic, new practices had to be developed. How have dancers adapted to this change in training mode and what challenges have they faced in teaching or learning online? In this paper, we propose to look at the challenges faced by teachers and learners of recreational dance. To do so, we will rely not only on the literature published on the subject, but also and especially, on interviews conducted with 78 professional and amateur dancers living in Quebec and France. We will highlight the technologies and teaching methods used in these courses as well as their advantages and limitations according to the teachers and learners. We will then open a discussion on the perspectives of online dance courses.\n:::\n\n### 2:00-2:30 | Que dit la recherche des approches pour contrer l’isolement en FAD ? (in French) \n\nResearch\n\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhile student isolation was a major issue during the pandemic, a systematic review of the literature conducted as part of the SSHRC’s Knowledge Synthesis program allowed us to review the scientific literature on support aimed at limiting the sense of isolation of students in distance education (DE). This study was conducted on scientific papers published between 2012 and 2022 and led to the examination of 301 articles in French or in English. The analysis of these publications highlights three main approaches to supporting distance education students: the approach focused on developing student autonomy and commitment; the approach focused on the support of a teacher or mentor; and the approach focused on peer-to-peer interactions and collaborative work. In this paper, we propose to review each of these three approaches and to outline the strengths and weaknesses that researchers have identified. We can then discuss how they can be addressed to provide DE. Finally, we will conclude with some possible directions for future research.\n:::\n\n\n### 2:30-3:00 | A Framework for Evaluating the Creation and Adaptation of Open Textbooks \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in dramatic growth in the use of open education resources, such as open textbooks, as classes moved online around the world. This highlighted the importance of evaluating the creation and adaptation of open textbooks used in online courses. In reviewing the research literature, I found existing rubrics or frameworks were outdated and lacked criteria that are important in today’s digital age. Therefore, I synthesized the evaluation and quality criteria from 31 articles into a single framework, which online instructors can consider using as they create or adapt an open textbook. The criteria include content, accessibility, technology, open licenses, instructional design, and a new category I termed verification.\n:::\n\n\n# 3:00-3:45  | Break \n\n\n# 3:45-5:15 | Concurrent Session 3 \n\n1.5 Hours\n\n## 3.1 |  Addressing Inequities \n\n\n\n\n### 3:45-4:45 | The Seemingly Small Details that are Easily Overlooked in Designing Inclusive Online Courses \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nWhile distance and online education are not new, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the challenges that students can face with online learning. These challenges can magnify inequity and increase resistance to learning. Many educators have used the pandemic as motivation to reassess their courses but still often overlook seemingly small aspects that can make a big difference for students. Examples of these aspects might include mobile compatibility, video length, and technological requirements. The three panelists are experienced instructional designers and instructors who have focused on improving accessibility in online learning in a variety of contexts. They will share their experiences as both advocates and skeptics on why we need to take the small things into account to develop courses which facilitate learning for all students without exhausting instructors who are experiencing their own barriers and challenges.\n:::\n\n\n### 4:45-5:15 | Podcasting for Student Agency \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThis article explores the potential of podcasting as a useful education technology for promoting agency in preservice teacher education programs. The authors propose a mixed-methods study to investigate the impact of co-creating podcasts as a holistic pedagogical practice. Reporting on the first phase of this research, podcasting appears to helpfully assess student learning. Additionally, it is a powerful technology that can mobilize knowledge created by preservice teachers beyond the classroom. Next stages in the research will incorporate in-service teachers to provide generative feedback, thereby creating a Community of Inquiry between podcasters and listeners.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.2 |  Sustaining Positive Change \n\n\n\n### 3:45-4:45 | The Slow Trend Toward K-12 OER Sharing\n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nFor K-12 teachers sharing resources is a long established professional practice and with the affordances of digital technologies the ability to file share has been amplified. However, there are technological and copyright implications of sharing curricular teaching content that requires more support and understanding. Copyright ease and ethical sharing of curriculum resources is provided by open licenses yet pre-service and graduate education students currently receive inconsistent tutelage of these licenses. To fill this niche for understanding, locating, or creating OER, the website Openteacherab.ca has been developed. Further support for these students to determine OER quality is the ISKME curation framework that assists with the selection and assessment of pre-existing K-12 OER. Looking to Washington State provides a further example of support for the slow trend toward K-12 OER sharing and development.\n:::\n\n### 4:45-5:15 | Letting Go of Holding On: Promoting Student Choice in a Post- Pandemic Classroom \n\nPractice\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nThe pandemic has forced teachers to adapt with greater flexibility to meet changing classroom environments and student needs, resulting in a shift in pedagogy towards promoting more intrinsic motivation and student autonomy. OTESSA’s theme of “Reckonings and Re-imaginings” reflects this transition, inviting educators to re-evaluate their approach. One effective way to achieve this kind of shift is to give students more freedom and choice in their learning, as supported by the work of Evans and Boucher (2015). This presentation will outline practical strategies for promoting more student choice in the classroom, such as incorporating formative assessment exercises, opening student work to include OER projects, and tips on changing one’s teaching mindset. Participants will be encouraged to reflect on opportunities for making small but meaningful changes to their pedagogy to inspire more student autonomy.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.3 |  Wildcard \n\n\n\n### 3:45 - 4:45 | Whiteboard Animation for Dental Education |  Research \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nTeaching complex scientific concepts in an engaging manner is challenging for educators. Animated videos can explain concepts and engage students by combining audio messages with changing graphics. Whiteboard animation is a style of animated video where the content appears to be hand-drawn on a whiteboard and narrated in a storytelling manner. This technique has the benefits of traditional animations, with the added ability to combine visual thinking and storytelling. Whiteboard animations were successfully applied to explain health-related topics. Creating a successful whiteboard animation requires paid software, time, and drawing skills. Most whiteboard animation software is designed for business advertising and does not provide the graphics gallery needed to explain health science-related topics.\n\nWe used traditional PowerPoint and hand-drawn digital images to create whiteboard animation explaining topics for dental education. The built-in animations of PowerPoint were used to animate the images and supporting text.\n\nWe aim to create a series of whiteboard animations for dental students. According to Dewey, learning is a social activity resulting from human interactions. Studies found that avatars, cartoon characters, dialogues, and simulated real-world settings in animated videos serve an essential social function in engaging students. We hope the whiteboard animations will be beneficial for dental students.\n:::\n\n\n### 4:45 - 5:15 | In-class gaming to improve students’ learning experiences in dental education \n\nResearch\n\nSpeaker\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nHigher educational institutes increasingly focus on incorporating games and simulations to enhance student engagement. Gamification refers to using or adopting game mechanics, techniques, and game theory in a non-game platform, like education. Many health professional education courses have successfully applied gamification. Online games like Kahoot are shown to increase student satisfaction and motivation, help students overcome individual difficulties, and improve collaboration. Gimkit is a new gaming platform that allows instructors to create quiz games that students can play live in class. The instantly generated code by the host allows students to enter live games without having an account or registration. We have introduced in-class gaming using Gimkit in the Dentistry and Dental Hygiene program at the University of Alberta. The effect of playing games on student learning, motivation, engagement, and satisfaction will be evaluated. We believe in-class gaming will be a positive incorporation in didactic dental education to enhance student motivation and engagement.\n:::\n\n\n## 3.4 |  Transitions of Online Learning & Teaching \n\n\n\n\n\n### 3:45 - 4:45 | Encadrer des étudiant.es à distance : Description des pratiques de nouveaux professeure.s (in French) \n\nResearch\n\n\nSpeaker\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Abstract\n\nCanadian higher education institutions are placing increasing emphasis on the development of distance education (DE) and online learning (Bates et al., 2017). Historically, in ADF institutions, the “traditional” teaching process is split into two phases. In the first stage, courses are designed by a professor or design team. Thereafter, student mentoring is assumed by a professor or designee (Racette et al., 2017). This involves accompanying students in their learning process, acting as a moderator, facilitator, coach, pedagogical mentor, e-tutor, coach, etc.\n\nWhen they take up their positions, new professors are quickly called upon to develop distance supervision practices and, as Vachon (2013) points out, to develop multiple skills such as written and oral communication, the use of ICT, etc.\n\nOver the past few months, a research team has been conducting an analysis of distance education student supervision practices. This research project, financed by the Fonds de recherche – Société et culture du gouvernement du Québec (FRQSC), allowed the deployment of the Observatoire du cours d’action. This theoretical framework allowed for the deployment of the relative life course tool, a methodological tool derived from the semiotic framework of the course of action (Theureau, 2004, 2009).\n\nThis project has three objectives: (1) to describe the coaching practices of new teachers in their ADF courses, (2) to explain how the coaching practices of new teachers evolve over time, and (3) to analyze how new teachers develop their skills in coaching practices in ADF courses.\n\nIn this paper, we propose to present the mentoring practices of new professors in distance education courses over the past few years.\n:::\n\n\n# Discussion/Networking Pod | 6:15-6:30
